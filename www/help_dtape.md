- Indirect Diameter Measurement: Measure the treeâ€™s circumference and convert it to diameter.
- Measurement Method:
    - Sling the loose end of the D-tape around the tree with your right hand and catch it with your left hand.
    - Pull the tape straight and taut around the tree, ensuring it is level and not angled.
    - Cross the right end over the left end, and read the diameter at the 0-line where the tape overlaps.
