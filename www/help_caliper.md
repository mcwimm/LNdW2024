- Placing the Caliper:
    - Position the caliper arms on either side of the tree trunk, perpendicular to the trunk.
- Ensure the caliper is at the same angle as the treeâ€™s lean (if present).
- Reading the Measurement:
    - Read the diameter from the caliper scale (in centimeters or inches).
- Take two measurements at right angles to each other:
    - First measurement: the largest diameter.
- Second measurement: at a right angle to the first measurement.
- Record the average of the two measurements as the diameter.
